We are media archæologists, gathering the dust that still falls in the East
Village of New York.

We are students in the “[Media History of
NYC](http://moacir.com/courses-nyu/media-history-of-nyc)” course taught in the
[Department of Media, Culture, and
Communication](http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/mcc/) at NYU by [Moacir P. de Sá
Pereira](http://moacir.com), from the [Department of
English](http://as.nyu.edu/english.html).
