[Text from Wikipedia, for now.]

Washington Square Park is a 9.75-acre (39,500 m2) public park in the Greenwich
Village neighborhood of Lower Manhattan, New York City. One of the best known
of New York City’s 1,900 public parks, it is a landmark as well as a meeting
place and center for cultural activity.[1] It is operated by the New York City
Department of Parks and Recreation.

The park is an open space, dominated by the Washington Square Arch at the
northern gateway to the park, with a tradition of celebrating nonconformity.
The park’s fountain area has long been one of the city’s popular spots for
residents and tourists. Most of the buildings surrounding the park now belong
to New York University, but many have at one time served as homes and studios
for artists. Some of the buildings have been built by NYU while others have
been converted from their former uses into academic and residential buildings.
