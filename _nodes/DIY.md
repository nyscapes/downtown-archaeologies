DIY, which stands for Do-It-Yourself, is an artistic method and somewhat of a movement in its own right. It's popular amongst punk and indie culture, and generally consists of creating art, film, music, and other media through simple inexpensive means with tools that the average person or artist would have access to. It's a counter to large scale productions that utilize pricey equipment and elaborate setups.
