Club 57 was an underground art and club venue that hosted many artists from the New York City area from 1978-1983. Artists such as Keith Haring, Jean-Michel Basquiat and many more would host events for the exclusive club members and it allowed for a creation of art and expression from the people who partook in the club's activities.
