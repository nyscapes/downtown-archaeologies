In what is now the location of the Pyramid Club, The New
Rican Village was a cultural arts center located on 101
Avenue A between 6th and 7th streets. A center where Puerto
Ricans and Latinos can express the Latino arts. As illustrated in the
artifacts, the New Rican Village was a forum for Puerto Rican
dance, music, theater, visual arts and poetry. It predominantly established
the Puerto Rican Arts. Founder of The New Rican Village, Eddie Figueroa
who was a member of the Young Lords, established this
cultural arts institution to reflect the aesthetic of Puerto
Rican roots with a twist of avant-garde.

It started with one of the Young Lords Party announcements at
Tompkins Square Park in 1969. To highlight activism by the
Young Lords within the context of the Lower East Side. In an
interview Eddie, just before his passing in 1990, elaborated on why the
Lower East Side was ideal for an inter-arts institution like the New Rican
Village, “There was all this energy down on the Lower East Side and so I
opened up the New Rican Village there. We brought together all of the arts,
with philosophy, a belief system, a dream vision, all of these things
together without a business perspective--that's what allowed the shit to fly,
cause it was so fuckin’ loose. You could come in and create whatever it is
that you wanted to do man.” Many known names in New York Puerto Rican
communities, like Pedro Pietri, Miriam Colon Jerry Gonzalez, and
Sandra Maria Estevez  were able to headline and showcase
their work at the New Rican Village. Figueroa's intentions
were to fuse the old traditional Puerto Rican roots with the
new culture of Puerto Ricans in New York City.

The NRV was open from 1976 to 1979, but continued to open in
other locations. The reason for the New Rican Village being so shortly lived
was because Figueroa made some clumsy and bad business choices and soon ran
out of funds to stay at the Lower East Side location. After a successful run
of about four years, Figueroa gave up the space, but refused to sell any
interest of his ventures to any outside investors. He then continued the
ultimate goal of the New Rican Village, "A Puerto Rican Renaissance" in other
venues.
