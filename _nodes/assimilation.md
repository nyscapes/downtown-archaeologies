Assimilation is generally understood as the integration of peoples into a certain society and a certain. It can be referred to in more specific ways, such as the adaption of a certain language or type of food.
Usually, immigrants are expected to assimilate to the country that they choose to reside in; however, cultures from abroad have made their way into New York City. The iconic 80's restaurant, El Internacional, attempted to make their mark on the city.
The restaurant was the first to introduce tapas, or small Spanish dishes, to downtown New York City. Not only did they introduce a never-before-seen food into the area, but they brought culture along as well. This attempt at reverse assimilation was met with much hostility from the neighborhood. Yet, the restaurant will forever be remembered as a bold move.
